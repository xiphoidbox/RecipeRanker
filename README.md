	breakfast, lunch, and dinner will take a few seconds to display. there is another 
  bug in the "view all recipes" scene, when you click the generate recipe button it will
  generate a recipe but instead of showing the recipe it will show "No Recipes Found" and "0 star"
  but it will continue to show recipes as long as you click "next recipe" or "previous recipe"
